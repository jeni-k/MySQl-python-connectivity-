The software named ‘Library Management System’ is developed to manage manual functions of a library. The software helps to manage the entire library operations from maintaining book records to issuing a book. In addition, it allows management of details of books such as book title, number of copies existing in the library etc. This system makes it easier to search books and find the right materials for students and the librarian instantly. Various features are:
1.Add and update books: LMS can add new books to the system with the essential details. Thus, the librarian can maintain the system effectively.
2.Record members: LMS can record members who have borrowed from or returned books to the library.
3.Search option: Librarian can search for library books/materials. He/She can search for books of the Library and get all the details like code, number of copies etc.
Issue and submission dates are also recorded by the LMS.
